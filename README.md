##spin chain and danymic way to obtain berry curvature
The notebook spin_chain caculates the berry curvature in Heisenberg spin-chain model.As for the method , I refered to  V. Gritsev,  6457â€“6462, doi: 10.1073/pnas.1116693109 .

##kagome lattice
The notebook about kagome lattice caculates the band structure of a kagome lattice in magnetic field.As for further reading , I refered to PHYSICAL REVIEW B 80, 113102 (2009) .

##kagome lattice edge mode
the notebook kagome lattice edge mode caculates the band structure including edge moge caused by broken translation symmetry.

# Notebook for learning quantum physic by QuTip
This is a repository of a student learning Qutip.
##spin chain
The notebook spin_chain caculates the berry curevature in Heisenberg spin-chain model.As for the method , I refered to  V. Gritsev,  6457â€“6462, doi: 10.1073/pnas.1116693109 .
##kagome lattice
The notebook about kagome lattice caculates the band structure of a kagome lattice in magnetic field.As for further reading , I refered to PHYSICAL REVIEW B 80, 113102 (2009) .
##kagome lattice edge mode
the notebook kagome lattice edge mode caculates the band structure including edge moge caused by broken translation symmetry.
